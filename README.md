Convulutional neural networks are used in order to analyse the edge detection generated images and to detect malicious disease.

SOBEL OPERATOR:This operator finds the edges by using Sobel approximation to the first order derivative.Sobel operator also relies on central differences. This is equivalent to the first derivative of the Gaussian blurring,obtained by applying the mask to the image.

PREWITT OPERATOR:This operator takes the values of the central difference between the neighbourhood pixels.The difference between sobel and prewitt is their mask values.

CANNY OPERATOR:Canny edge detection is a technique to extract useful structural information from different vision objectsand dramatically reduce the amount of data to be processed.
